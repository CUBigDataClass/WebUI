          <h5>About</h5>
            I am a non-traditional student, returning to CU at 38 in order to
            complete a second bachelors degree.  My first degree in Business
            Information Systems was a great introduction to computing.  As
            the duties at my job moved into more Software Engineering tasks
            I found I had gaps in knowledge that were holding me back.  I
            will be finishing my degree in the Spring of 2014.
            <p><p>
            After graduation I will be returning to work at
            <a href="http://www.spectralogic.com">Spectra Logic</a>,
            where I have been employed for 13 years.  My current team is
            working on a FreeBSD backend/Ruby on Rails front end for a disk
            storage appliance designed to pair with our line of tape libraries.
            I also manage the development lab at Spectra, approximately 200
            servers.
            <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy brewing beer, mead, wine and ciders.  I
            also like to garden and swim.
          <br>
          <h5>Role</h5>
            I am interested in the infrastructure side of projects.  I was the
            point person for interacting with AWS, spinning up and configuring
            the servers we needed to complete the project.
            <p><p>
            I also did initial deployments of Hadoop and a single instance Storm
            "cluster" as our project workflows changed.
            <p>
            Finally, I contributed to some of the web development and
            integration.
          <br>
          <h5>What I learned</h5>
            I came to this course knowing that Big Data was Hadoop and
            deploying things to the cloud.  I hoped to gain hard skills in
            those areas.  Instead what I found was that there is a LOT more to
            this area than I thought.  If the only tool you have is a hammer
            then everything begins to look like a nail.  Now I know there are
            many different tools and projects out there for dealing with data
            at scale, the benifits of using one over the other, and a basic
            point to start working with them for future work.
            <p><p>
            During the course of the project, the importance of using some type
            of Agile process was made clear.  Our project morphed not only in
            what information we were trying to convey, but also in the
            technologies used.  We cycled through Hadoop, Storm, and LSA as
            major foundations, as well as exporing other spaces along the way.
            Without the flexibility that Agile gives, the project would have
            never reached completion.
