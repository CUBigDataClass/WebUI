        TopXX (pronounced Topics) applies Big Data technology and concepts to 
        examine the Twitter Firehose and extract the top 20 words that have 
        been tweeted for major cities. These words are then displayed in a 
        visually dynamic manner to focus interest in the data.
        <br>
        <br>
        By creating a framework to gather, parse, and analyze tweets, we have 
        demonstrated a platform that can be used for deeper analysis of topics 
        and trends in targeted market segments.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h5 class="panel-title">Data Workflow</h5>
        <br>
        A visual representation of the project workflow is presented under the
        ‘About' section.
        <br>
        <br>
        A server running in AWS EC2 uses the public Twitter API to gather 
        tweets from their firehose.  The API is used to filter the tweets to 
        those with geotagging enabled, in English, and from the Unites States.
        As the tweets come in, they are converted to strings and placed in a 
        Kafka queue.  
        <br>
        <br>
        This queue serves as a data source that Zookeeper vends out to a Kafka 
        consumer which first checks to see if the tweet is in one of our target
        cities.  If it is, the script cleans up the tweet text by removing 
        “filler” words such as “I”, “and”, and “or” which do not convey 
        information we need.  It also tokenizes, converts to lower case, and 
        removes @ and # data.   
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the data is parsed, its word count is inserted into a MongoDB 
        storage instance, with one JSON document for each city.  If the word 
        has not been seen before, it is added to the document.  If it exists, 
        the count is incremented.
        <br>
        <br>
        After the data is stored, a separate EC2 instance, serving as our web 
        server takes over.  When a user selects a city, a PHP request is sent 
        to the backend server’s MongoDB.  It returns an array of the top 20 
        tweeted words for that city, and the associated count.  The web server 
        front end can then present a color coded histogram of the data.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        We set out with goals of using “Big Data” to create a platform that 
        will aggregate Twitter data (“tweets”) into an interactive and visually
        appealing representation.  In order to achieve this goal, we collected 
        metadata from the Twitter fire hose using Twitter Streaming APIs.  The 
        metadata includes: the geolocation of the tweet, the grammatical 
        content of the tweet itself, and the timestamp of the tweet.  We are 
        using a bar chart or histogram as our digital interface; and we have 
        chosen to represent the most frequent word count (based on the words in
        the “tweet”) in the U.S. with the top 20 words for each location 
        represented in our graph.
        <br>
        <br>
        A second goal of this project is to create an interactive 
        representation.  This was accomplished through our Twitter “Map” page, 
        where users have the opportunity to select from various city options in
        the ultimate goal of creating a customized representation of a word 
        frequency graph for each city listed.  This is done through the use of 
        a front-end selection system that links to a back-end API, which 
        subsequently queries the incoming stream of word frequency counts for 
        Tweets and pushed that data back to our GUI, running through JQuery to 
        create the bar charts for each city.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, we set to make this site visually appealing.  We have created 
        a user flow that is easily navigable and inviting for users to enjoy 
        their experience with our graphs.  We have made the individual word 
        frequency data set easily distinguishable from the other data sets on 
        each graph through color schemes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our motivation for this project is to demonstrate how “Big Data” is 
        relevant and meaningful to users of all backgrounds.  We decided on 
        word frequency count as our plotted measure, because we thought it 
        would be fascinating to see where parts of the U.S. tend to use certain
        words more frequently than other parts and how those differences change
        through the factor of location.  It is also in our interest to see 
        whether these changes are moderated by other factors, such as time.
        <br>
        <br>
        In an attempt to show the awesome power of “Big Data”, we thought 
        Twitter to be a valid platform to access the word frequency information.
        Through this project, we hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of our 
        graphical representation as a way to visualize word frequency for Tweets
        in the United States.
